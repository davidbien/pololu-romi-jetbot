The Donkey Car HSP 94186 chassis doen't seem a particularly popular model.

If you look on Banggood you'll find far more popular models: <https://www.banggood.com/Wholesale-RC-Car-c-1753-0-1-4-36-0_page1.html>

They appear to have sold no HSP 94186 chassis.

Number 1 is the Turingy Trooper - which is a suggested Donkey Car chassis - at 1/10 it's quite big though.

Tamiya produce a huge range of chassis - unfortunately their website is terrible. A Tamiya chassis without unneeded body looks like a nice option.

Remember all these cars are probably built for speed, and many are built for all-terrain.

Whereas a gear ratio of 34:1 or 75:1 like the the Pololu Wild Thumper with high torque might be more appropriate and giving up some all-terrain performance might make for greater stability, less bounce, in flat indoor environments.

It'd be interesting to know what experience ETH has with chassis - <https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2018/01/lab-for-self-driving-vehicles.html>
